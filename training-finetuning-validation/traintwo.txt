Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Red Riding Hood.
She lived with her mother on the edge of a large forest.
One day, her mother told her to take some food to her grandmother who was sick.
Red Riding Hood put on her red cloak and set off through the forest.

The sun was shining brightly, and the birds were singing in the trees.
Red Riding Hood enjoyed her walk through the woods, picking flowers along the way.
She met a wolf who asked her where she was going.
She told him she was going to her grandmother's house.
