These models excel at capturing the contextual information in the source language and generating coherent and accurate translations in the target language.

While they share similar characteristics, such as being capable of capturing long-term dependencies in sequential data, there are certain scenarios where GRUs may be preferred over LSTMs. Here are a few cases:\n",

If you have limited computational resources or need to process large amounts of data quickly, GRUs may be a more efficient choice.\n",

LSTMs tend to have more parameters due to their additional memory cell, which can lead to overfitting when data is limited. GRUs' simpler structure may mitigate this issue and provide better generalization with smaller amounts of training data.\n",
