Each decision tree is constructed by randomly selecting a subset of features from the dataset, and the final prediction is made by aggregating the predictions of all the individual trees. This technique helps in reducing overfitting and improving the accuracy and robustness of the model. Random Forests can be used for both classification and regression tasks and is known for its ability to handle high-dimensional data and variable importance estimation."

Unlike Random Forests, Gradient Boosted Trees builds the trees in a sequential manner, where each subsequent tree tries to correct the mistakes made by the previous tree. The model focuses on the residuals or errors of the previous trees and uses a gradient descent optimization algorithm to minimize the overall prediction error. Gradient Boosted Trees are effective for both regression and classification tasks, and they are known for their high predictive power and interpretability."

The splits are determined by finding the optimal threshold that maximizes the purity or homogeneity of the target variable within each resulting subset. CART can handle both categorical and numerical features, making it a versatile algorithm. It can be used for both classification and regression tasks, as it can predict discrete classes or continuous values based on the tree structure. CART is simple to understand and interpret, but it can be prone to overfitting if not properly regularized.\n",
